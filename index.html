<h2>Original Code into New Code</h2>
<p class="info-text">
  Here we have my original project.<br>
  Which originally was an Event Tracker app, that later rotated into a FitnessApp.<br>
  Below, the first link will take you to my original Event Tracker app.<br>
  The second link will take you to the finished GeminiAiFitness app\
  Lastly the Final link is the Database that goes along with GeminiAiFitness.<br><br>

<h2>Artifact Reflection</h2>
<p class="info-text">
  In this project, I applied several enhancements that reflect both technical growth and alignment with key course outcomes. These improvements showcase my ability to adapt to modern development practices, implement responsive UI, and integrate full-stack components.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">üîÑ Rewriting the App from Java to Kotlin</h3>
<p class="info-text">
  I refactored the original Java-based Event Tracker into a Kotlin-based application. This shift improved code clarity, reduced boilerplate, and aligned with contemporary Android development practices.
</p>

<h3>üé® Enhanced UI with Jetpack Compose</h3>
<p class="info-text">
  By adopting Jetpack Compose, I was able to build a modern, fluid, and reactive interface. Compose allowed for faster UI development and a more intuitive experience for users, especially when navigating between features like the calendar and workout settings.
</p>

<h3>üóÑÔ∏è Backend & Database Integration Using Go</h3>
<p class="info-text">
  I implemented a Go-based backend with a custom database to securely handle user registration and login. This integration demonstrated my understanding of RESTful API design, backend logic, and persistent data storage outside of the mobile device.
</p>

<h3>üéØ Alignment with Course Outcomes</h3>
<ul style="color: #444; line-height: 1.6;">
  <li>Applied modern object-oriented principles through Kotlin conversion.</li>
  <li>Utilized Jetpack Compose to design and implement a responsive UI.</li>
  <li>Built and connected a secure backend to demonstrate full-stack development capabilities.</li>
  <li>Incorporated state management and data handling within both frontend and backend systems.</li>
</ul>

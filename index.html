  <h1>Welcome to my ePortfolio</h1>
  <div class="subtitle">Glad you're here</div>



  <h2>Name</h2>
  <p class="myName">Pedro Garcia Marrufo</p>



<h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
<p class="BioExplanation">
  When I first began my journey at SNHU, I had a basic understanding of coding and experience primarily in Java. Through my coursework and project work, I developed skills in languages such as C++, Python, and Kotlin, while also gaining hands-on experience in software engineering principles, data structures, and security fundamentals.<br><br>

  Throughout the program, I had the opportunity to modulate assignments that simulated real-world team dynamics. These experiences taught me how to contribute effectively in a team environment, navigate shared responsibilities, and communicate clearly during development cycles.<br><br>

  I also learned how to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I was asked to present my work and defend my design choices, which helped me build confidence in articulating complex ideas to a diverse audience.<br><br>

  The core project showcased in this portfolio began in CS360 as an event tracker app written in Java. To better reflect my current abilities, I re-engineered this application in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose, added responsive UI, and incorporated a Go-based backend to securely handle user authentication. This progression highlights my mastery of modern mobile development, backend integration, and secure database practices.<br><br>

  Outside of this artifact, I‚Äôve also explored cybersecurity principles and basic penetration testing in elective coursework, which has deepened my appreciation for secure design and ethical development practices.<br><br>

  Together, the artifacts in this portfolio demonstrate a well-rounded technical foundation from front-end design to back-end architecture and illustrate my ability to learn, adapt, and contribute meaningfully in the computer science field. They represent not only the skills I've built, but also the values I bring as a developer: collaboration, clarity, continuous learning, and user-focused design.

<h2>Original Artifact into New Artifact</h2>
<div class="CodeJourney">
  <p>
    Here we have my original project.<br>
    It originally began as an Event Tracker app and eventually evolved into a fully functional fitness app called <strong>GeminiAiFitness</strong>.<br>
    Below, you'll find links to the progression of this project ‚Äî from the initial version to the complete fitness app, as well as the Go backend that supports it.

<h2>Artifact Reflection</h2>
<div class="ReflectionBox">

  <p>
    In this project, I applied several enhancements that reflect both technical growth and alignment with key course outcomes.
    These improvements showcase my ability to adapt to modern development practices, implement responsive UI, and integrate full-stack components.
  </p>

  <h3>üîÑ Rewriting the App from Java to Kotlin</h3>
  <p>
    I refactored the original Java-based Event Tracker into a Kotlin-based application.
    This shift improved code clarity, reduced boilerplate, and aligned with contemporary Android development practices.
  </p>

  <h3>üé® Enhanced UI with Jetpack Compose</h3>
  <p>
    By adopting Jetpack Compose, I was able to build a modern, fluid, and reactive interface.
    Compose allowed for faster UI development and a more intuitive experience for users,
    especially when navigating between features like the calendar and workout settings.
  </p>

  <h3>üóÑÔ∏è Backend & Database Integration Using Go</h3>
  <p>
    I implemented a Go-based backend with a custom database to securely handle user registration and login.
    This integration demonstrated my understanding of RESTful API design, backend logic,
    and persistent data storage outside of the mobile device.
  </p>

  <h3>üéØ Alignment with Course Outcomes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Applied modern object-oriented principles through Kotlin conversion.</li>
    <li>Utilized Jetpack Compose to design and implement a responsive UI.</li>
    <li>Built and connected a secure backend to demonstrate full-stack development capabilities.</li>
    <li>Incorporated state management and data handling within both frontend and backend systems.</li>
  </ul>
